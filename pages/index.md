Hey, I am Jessy Tsui, a dedicated tech innovator and entrepreneur with a passion for psychology, metaphysics, and environmental science. I believe rigorous logical reasoning and quantifiable research drive innovation.

Founder of DataTager、ChatLaw<br>
ex Peking University RA<br>
Alibaba ModelScope DevRel<br>
iFLYTEK Honorary lecturer<br>
Core team of ChatPaper<br>

At DataTager, our mission is to help every enterprise, organization, and team solve their "data" problems efficiently. In early 2023, we stood at the forefront of large model applications, deeply involved in the high-star project ChatPaper, and subsequently initiated the training of the legal large model ChatLaw.

ChatLaw received excellent feedback. However, during commercialization, we realized that simply enhancing the general capabilities of large models was insufficient to solve practical implementation issues. We needed to analyze specific situations and conduct targeted training.

Thus, at the beginning of 2024, we started training the DataTager data processing model. After three months of internal testing, 13 teams generated a total of 3.91 million post-processed data entries, and our synthetic data and data augmentation products delivered satisfactory results to our clients.

We then embarked on product development and commercial PR. We believe it is crucial to help each client generate subtask datasets tailored to their specific scenarios and obtain large models capable of addressing their needs.

We span multiple fields, including traditional Chinese medicine, law, finance, education, federated learning, reinforcement learning, and Web3. Each feedback from our clients propels us forward.

I give talks and write blog posts about AI, data processing, coding, and tutorials. Occasionally, I also do some coding live streams on YouTube and 哔哩哔哩.
